Most of the creatures in the game were accidently (other as B.O.W.s) transformed into monsters by two type of virus, one being called T-virus (or Tyrant-Virus) and the other G-Virus (or Golgotha-Virus), devolopt by the Umbrella Corporation and William Birkin (one of main antagonists of game). The T-Virus promoted mutations making any living thing a undestructable monster, however the G-Virus was was even stronger making the infected capable of regenerating its own body and growing into enormous size. The game takes place in Tree places of <a href="https://i.redd.it/o0c03w2g3w921.jpg">Raccoon City</a> (which was the hometown of Umbrella, that conducted many types of experiments in secret laboratories hiddem in depths of the city.).The Tree being <a href="https://wallpapershome.com/images/pages/pic_h/19126.jpg">The R.P.D</a>, <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/residentevil/images/8/84/Sewers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200115120412">The Sewers</a> and <a href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/016/960/160/large/danny-greenan-shot1.jpg?1554136933">"The Nest"</a> (secret Laboratory)</li></ul></h1>
